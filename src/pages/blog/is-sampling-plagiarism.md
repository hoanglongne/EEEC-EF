Humans thrived thanks to the recognition of patterns, it allows us to predict and expect what is coming. However, at where we are now on top of the food chain, too much identification could just simply become a **hindrance** to our relaxing afternoons, especially when it comes to music. Ever heard of two songs so similar you swear they could exchange the lyrics and would still remain the same? Or maybe a snippet from an instrumental? For the most part, that falls into the handiwork of sampling, but at what point is **interpreting** another’s work considered art theft? In the existing circumstances, there are a number of factors that differentiate the two, though only by a fine line.

To categorize something, one must first understand the concept. Oxford Languages defines sampling as “the technique of digitally encoding music or sound and reusing it as part of a composition or recording.” This only implies that you are taking somebody else’s product and employing it as your own while there are a lot more **nuances** in play. When a song is sampled, two copyrights are being taken: the copyright from the sound recording and the unique composition within that recording. Consequently, this makes clearing samples a requirement. Obtaining permissions from both the song writer and the record label is a **prerequisite** for any creative **implications**. Yet, this piece of information still resides within a gray area for the masses. As a matter of fact, the misconstruction about the idea behind sampling had led to many controversies, the most recent being the striking similarities in a certain line between Tiên Cookies’ and Bích Phương’s ‘Đi đu đưa đi’ and Charli XCX’s ‘Used to know me.’ As much as it would frustrate the local fans and despite the **notoriety**, the probability of plagiarism is rather thin; ‘Used to know me’ is a case where samples are clearly listed, all writers are credited, and royalties are paid. In this instance, it could be wrapped up as a loose coincidence when **interpolating** ‘Show me love’ by Robin S.

Behind all controversies though, is the lack of factual information. As old as music is in the history of mankind, sampling is a baby of a concept, popularized by the rise of Hip Hop culture and made possible by the advancements of technology. Nevertheless, that notion is about to take another turn, as Rap music penetrates itself into the scene of Vietnamese Pop, sampling is **picking up steam** among young producers. Following the trend of modernization of classics, Lê Cát Trọng Lý makes frequent appearances in songs from artists like Đen and Cam, two of the biggest Rap artists in Vietnam. Larria is also a **household name** among Vietnamese Hip Hop enthusiasts, with tracks such as Tóc Ngắn, sampling a song with the same name from Mỹ Linh, or the charts topping Tam Giác, interpolating a more contemporary hit from the rapper LK, Hà Nội Xịn.

As it stands, samples and sampling culture have been and will continue to play an important role in the landscape of music. Although arguments surrounding if a piece of sound can actually be owned has plagued the industry for years, as is, sampling itself is not plagiarism but the answer instead lies on how one defines a sample and whether or not the use of another artist’s work is permitted. For a considerable population of artists, sampling is a way to pay homage to their favorites, to those who have built the foundation so that they could walk. And from this point onwards, it is inevitable that the **eschewing** of sampling will slowly fade, and the sprinkle of samples will certainly bring about many more tasteful songs.
