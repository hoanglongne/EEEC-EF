A book for summertime bounce, refresh your holiday with a glass of orange juice and “My Sweet Orange Tree”.

From its inception, this South American children’s classic novel, carrying a glimpse of the **autobiographical** genre, is a phenomenal success at its home – Brazil, and became the most renowned work of José Mauro de Vasconcelos. The book is **meritorious**in many aspects, including the storyline and the flow of emotions.

The story follows Zezé – a five, almost six years old, highly **precocious** yet **obstreperous** boy. His small companion on the journey to “*discover pain and love*”, is a sweet orange tree in the backyard of his new house, and a fellow, a real person, who will have a big impact on his life later on. The first few chapters bring a humorous, innocent, and bright tone, through mischievous pranks pulled by Zezé and his tremendous capacity for kindness and compassion. Then, the latter half closes on a sorrowful theme, adding a bit of bitterness because of the unpredictable twist just before the ending.

With a medium length in addition to a simple, daily life **penmanship** andextraordinary **narrative** power, the classic book is **legible** and eventually, inspires great empathy from readers. Additionally, meaningful messages hidden behind each phrase are uncomplicated to realize and concur with. The book reminds us that beauty comes from simple things; and exposes **unreservedly** the iniquity of poverty, the human need for kindness, and the search for the purpose of life.

However, we will not discuss any further into the plot, as we believe every small phrase are **incremental** fragments that together create the impressive and memorable ending, which is another factor that contributes to the success of this novel. Nevertheless, from the reviewer’s perspective, this classical “children’s book” may be more appropriate for adults, who have experienced childhood, as for the painful scars and **vicious** visuals appearing among the story, and some of the messages may be **cryptic** for kids.

In closing, although the book may not live up to most readers’ expectations, we would say “My Sweet Orange Tree” is regardless a beautiful and emotional read after a hard-working day.
