“Violent Night” is a Christmas movie that came out early December, 2022. Starring David Harbour as Santa and directed by Tommy Wirloka. Nearly two hours of action-packed fight scenes did nothing to take away the amount of Christmas joy this movie brings. The message it carries is simple: enjoy Christmas again, you cynical people!

First thing to note, “Violent Night” comes rated R (18+). For a movie that is just under two hours long, that rating probably doesn’t seem fair at first. Swears and sexual innuendos are just part and parcel of action movies. However, as the movie progresses, so does the amount of violence and gore. It is not excessive to the point that it takes away from the fun of seeing an atypical Christmas movie, but it definitely packs big enough of a punch. So when you inevitably see this turn up on the TV screen, perhaps don’t tune in with children around.

On the other hand, this is a funny movie. It isn’t like “22 Jump Street” funny, that can leave you literally rolling on the floor laughing or wiping tears from your eyes. This movie brings about more of a subtle humor, like joy lacing in your bones and you can’t help but smile. There’s a washed up Santa, a dysfunctional family held together by tape and glue and a single child, stubbornly holding onto her belief in Santa and Christmas. 

Another reason why this movie is so great, everything in here has a Christmas theme. The merry band of home robbers have code names of Christmas things. The leader’s childhood trauma is related to Christmas. He even named himself Mr. Scrooge, a clear reference to a dreadful man who feels no Christmas joy and even ruins it for others. Because most of the movie is set in the mansion home of a millionaire, every room, every hallway, everywhere you turn is decked out in full Christmas decoration. Who doesn’t like a movie that stays on theme?

Lastly, let us say that “Violent Night” is a movie for lovers of Christmas. Despite having elements of modern movies like politics and gun violence. The essence of Christmas stays true throughout. Even with actual magic in the mix, it doesn’t make the main character – Santa’s struggle seem trivial or unrealistic. In fact, the biggest problem he must overcome is everyone, including himself, giving up on their belief in Christmas. However, unlike other people, he isn’t just slowly losing a holiday amongst many, but his sense of self and the purpose for his existence. It isn’t until he meets little Trudy Lightstone, despite being surrounded by the influence of her jaded family, is fighting harder than he to not lose her faith in Christmas. 

We came in with no expectation, thinking this is just another action, thriller movie with Santa on the cover as an excuse to make Christmas-themed jokes. What we got is an earnest journey shared by two characters, who are only connected by their intangible and vulnerable hope in the same precious thing. It sounds ridiculous and unbelievable, but this year, there is magic in the air. So before the holiday is through, let “Violent Night” rekindle your love for Christmas this and every year that follows.
